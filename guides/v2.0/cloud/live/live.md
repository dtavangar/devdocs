This section outlines the tasks you must perform before you can launch your live Magento store. 

To go live:

1.	Log in to your Magento Cloud account.
2.	Click **Support** > **Submit ticket** from the top menu.

	The following figure shows an example.

	![]({{ site.baseurl }}common/images/cloud_support-ticket.png){:width="600px"}
1.	Follow the prompts to open an issue with Support.

	Support assists you with your live deployment and gives you an IP address for your live site so you can set up DNS.
3.	Configure DNS.

	After you've checked with your registrar about where to change your DNS settings, add a CNAME record that references the Master environment's host name: `<environment>-<project>.<region>.magentosite.cloud`

	If you use multiple host names for your site, you must add a CNAME record for each of them. 

	<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info" id="info">
  		<p>This will not work for an <a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/zone-apex-naked-domain-root-domain-cname-supp" target="_blank">apex domain</a> (also referred to as a <em>naked</em> domain). In that case, you must use a DNS provider that supports forwarding DNS queries.</p>
	</div>

	Some DNS providers you can consider follow:

	*	CNAME with ALIAS record from [Dyn](http://dyn.com){:target="_blank"} 
	*	ANAME record on [DNS Made Easy](http://www.dnsmadeeasy.com){:target="_blank"}
	*	ANAME at [easyDNS](https://www.easydns.com){:target="_blank"}
	*	ACNAME at [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com){:target="_blank"}
	*	ALIAS at [PointDNS](https://pointhq.com){:target="_blank"}

	Magento does not endorse or support these companies; we mention them for your information only.

	Many other providers also offer workarounds to accomplish this goal. The most common is to add a CNAME record for the `www` host on the domain and then use the DNS provider's redirection service to redirect the apex over to the `www` version of the domain. Consult your DNS provider to see how they support this.

	We support `www.domain.tld CNAME <environment>-<project>.<region>.magentosite.cloud` 

	We don't support `domain.tld CNAME <environment>-<project>.<region>.magentosite.cloud`
4.	Make sure that the Fastly SSL certificate is setup for your final live domain(s)
